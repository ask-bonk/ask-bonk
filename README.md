Just `/bonk` it.

It's a code (and docs!) review agent that responds to mentions in issues and PRs. Built on [OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode), Bonk can review code, answer questions about your codebase, and make changes directly by opening PRs and telling you where you can do better.

- **Code & doc review** - Get feedback on PRs, explain code, or ask questions about your repo just by mentioning `/bonk` in an issue, PR comment or even line comments.
- **Make changes** - Bonk can edit files and create PRs from issues and update PRs.
- **Fully configurable** - Supports any [model provider](https://opencode.ai/docs/providers) that OpenCode does (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.). Why reinvent the wheel when there's a perfectly round one already?

## Quick Start

1. Install the [ask-bonk GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/ask-bonk) on your repository
2. Add `OPENCODE_API_KEY` to your repository secrets (**Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**) - [get one here](https://opencode.ai/api-keys)
3. Mention `@ask-bonk` or `/bonk` in any issue or PR

On first mention, Bonk will create a PR to add the workflow file to your repo.

### Using Other Providers

[Any OpenCode provider](https://opencode.ai/docs/providers/) is supported. Update your `bonk.yml` workflow file to specify a different model and pass the appropriate API key:

```yaml
      - name: Run Bonk
        uses: sst/opencode/github@dev
        env:
          ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
        with:
          model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
```

## Usage

Mention the bot in any issue or PR:

```
@ask-bonk fix the type error in utils.ts
```

Or use the slash command:

```
/bonk add tests for the auth module
```

### Examples

- `@ask-bonk review this PR` - Get a code review
- `/bonk explain how the auth system works` - Ask questions about the codebase
- `@ask-bonk fix the failing tests` - Let Bonk make changes and push commits
- `/bonk add documentation for the API endpoints` - Generate documentation

## Config

### Defaults

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Mention trigger | `@ask-bonk` |
| Slash command | `/bonk` |
| Model | `opencode/claude-opus-4-5` |

### OpenCode Config

For advanced configuration (custom providers, system prompts, etc.), create `.opencode/opencode.jsonc` in your repository. See [OpenCode docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/config) for all options.

```jsonc
{
  "provider": {
    "anthropic": {}
  },
  "model": {
    "default": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
  }
}
```
